# mSecure-Dump

A tool to extract and decrypt the entries from backup files of the mSecure 4 password manager.
Data is dumped into plaintext CSV files.

Tested with AutoBackup files generated by mSecure 4.0.5.006 on Android (`/sdcard/mSecure`).

## example

Just run the main program via `sbt` with the following arguments: `<msim filepath> <passphrase> <output dir>`

```scala
sbt:mSecure-Dump> run mSecureAutoBackup_2019-01-22_11.25.30.msim myPassword out
```

and you will find your dumped credentials in the selected output directory.
